liblfds, a portable, license-free, lock-free data structure library written in C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lock-free data structures are process, thread and interrupt safe (i.e. the same
data structure instance can be safely used across processes, threads and both
inside and outside of interrupt handlers), never sleep (and so are safe for
kernel use when sleeping is not permitted), operate without context switches,
cannot fail (no need to handle error cases, as there are none), perform and
scale literally orders of magnitude better than locking data structures, and
liblfds itself (as of release 7.0.0) is implemented such that it performs no
allocations and compiles not just on a freestanding C89 implementation, but on
a bare C89 implementation.
